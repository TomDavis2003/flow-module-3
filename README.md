## Authentication Contract

The `Authentication` contract defines a structure for managing company profiles. It includes the following features:

- **Company Profile Struct**: The `comp` struct represents a company's profile, containing details such as car name, model, price, color, and model number.
- **Add Profile Function**: The contract provides a function to add a new company profile to the system, storing it in a mapping using the model number as the key.

## Transaction Scripts

Transaction scripts are provided to interact with the `Authentication` contract. These scripts enable users to perform actions such as adding new company profiles.

### Transaction: Add Profile

The `addProfile` transaction script allows users to add a new company profile to the authentication system. It takes parameters for car details such as name, model, price, color, and model number, and adds the profile to the `Authentication` contract.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Deploy the `Authentication` contract to the blockchain.
2. Execute transaction scripts to interact with the contract, such as adding new company profiles.
